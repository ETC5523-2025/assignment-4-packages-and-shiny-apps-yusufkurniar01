The original PPS snapshot (2011) provides total counts and uncertainty by HAI category. Monthly values for 2011 – 2012 are simulated by distributing annual totals across months with mild winter seasonality and some random variation. Weekly values are estimated by dividing each month into ISO weeks, using a smooth within-month weighting profile. Daily values are calculated by dividing each week into seven days, with a slight weekday effect. All simulations ensure non-negativity and stay within plausible ranges relative to the original totals.
